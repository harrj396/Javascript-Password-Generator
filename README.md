# Javascript Password Generator
## Description

This is a custom password generator made in Javascript.  It allows you to create a password with a custom length, and you can choose to include or exclude certain characters including lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.  This was created for week 3 of my coding bootcamp, and helped me learn a lot about Javascript.  It combines a lot of topics I was only vaugly familier with in Javascript. It really pushed my problem solving skills as I had a few errors I genuinely thought I wouldn't be able to figure out on my own that I was able to walk through and find the solution.


## Installation

Go to the following website, click on Generate Password and follow the on screen instructions.

## Usage

Once on the website, click on Generate Password. Click Ok on the popup, then enter a number of how many characters you want your password to be.  Continue by selecting what you want in your password, such as upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, or special characters.  Press Ok to confirm, then copy your new password!

## Credits

Thank you so much to my classmates for helping me with this project.
